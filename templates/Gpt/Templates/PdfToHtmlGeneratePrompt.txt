I want you to extract and recreate a professional resume layout from a PDF or image I provide. Your output must be a clean and accurate HTML file with embedded CSS that matches the original formatting exactly — including:

- Font sizes and weights
- Section spacing and alignment
- Two-column layout for organization/location vs. date
- Bullet point indentation
- Bold/italic text styles
- Proper link formatting
- Consistent margins and spacing
- Matching visual hierarchy as seen in the original

⚠️ Do not simplify or reformat the content. Maintain the exact structure, labels, and formatting.

Output only a complete HTML file with embedded CSS — ready to open in the browser or export as PDF. Do not add any summaries or commentary. Focus on pixel-perfect layout reproduction.
